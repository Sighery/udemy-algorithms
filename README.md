This repository will hold some of the coding exercises from [a Udemy course on
Data Structures and Algorithms
](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/).

There's usually solution videos for these exercises, but I tend to implement
some things in different ways, and I use these exercises to play around with new
ES6 features (so iterating in a Doubly Linked List is done with generators, for
instance).

That's why I decided to make my own repository and keep some of my own
implementations since they could come in handy some day, or I might want to
check up on how I implemented something so I could just come back here.

PS: Don't just copy the solution, you won't be learning anything.
